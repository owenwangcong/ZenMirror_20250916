# The ZenMirror Story

By Owen Wang, Founder of Aeonlectron

For 15 years, I've been a meditation practitioner and electrical engineer—two worlds that rarely intersect. I've studied with Zen masters in Toronto, Vipassana retreats in Thailand, and Stoic philosophy in university. Each tradition offered profound wisdom, yet they all shared one limitation: I was practicing blind. As an engineer, I rely on precise measurements. Yet in meditation, I had zero objective data. Chest straps were distracting. Fitness trackers missed HRV nuances. EEG headbands felt like lab equipment.

## The Breakthrough

A year ago, I contemplated the problem deeply, investigated many sensing technologies, and kept returning to millimeter-wave radar. After rigorous evaluation, I decided to pursue it. Everything clicked. Radar is completely non-intrusive—no contact, no cameras, works through clothing. You meditate exactly as you do, yet it captures breathing, heartbeat, and HRV with incredible precision. That night, I sketched ZenMirror: a system measuring HRV, RSA, and breath-heart coherence through contemplative science frameworks.

## The Solution

I spent 10 months in "technical meditation"—engineering by day, testing by night. The challenge was philosophical: how to quantify meditation without judgment? The answer came from the traditions. Zen teaches observation without judgment. Stoicism distinguishes control from spontaneity. Vedanta sees the witness untouched. I designed ZenMirror to reflect, not judge. I brought in experts from six wisdom traditions using RAG technology to ensure authentic, deeply rooted feedback.

## Join Me

I see millions meditating with quiet confidence—beginners watching breath settle in real-time, advanced practitioners breaking plateaus, professionals getting stress reminders. But more: bridges between ancient wisdom and modern science, between traditions separated by culture. ZenMirror represents 15 years of practice, 1 year of development, and a conviction that ancient wisdom and technology can partner in awareness. This isn't just a product—it's a community believing deep understanding helps us live wisely. **The cushion is ready. Will you join me?**
