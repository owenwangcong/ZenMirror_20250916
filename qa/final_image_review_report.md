### 3. Indiegogo Mockups
**File:** `D:\Projects\ZenMirror_20250916\outputs\ui-developer\indiegogo_mockups\index.html`

#### STATUS: Similar pattern to final campaign
- Local assets missing in `./assets/` directories
- Shared assets (`../../assets/images/`) working correctly
- Needs same fixes as final campaign version

### 4. Kickstarter Mockups
**File:** `D:\Projects\ZenMirror_20250916\outputs\ui-developer\kickstarter_mockups\index.html`

#### STATUS: Similar pattern to final campaign
- Local asset directory structure incomplete
- Icons and supplementary graphics missing
- Core shared assets functional

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Asset Directory Structure Gap
The campaign pages reference two different asset locations:
1. **Shared Assets** (`../../assets/images/`) - ✅ WORKING
2. **Local Assets** (`./assets/`) - ❌ MISSING

### Path Pattern Analysis:
```
WORKING PATHS:
../../assets/images/branding/zenmirror-logo.png
../../assets/images/product/zenmirror-device.png
../../assets/images/mentors/zen-master.png
../../assets/images/app/dashboard.png
../../assets/images/technology/radar-visualization.png

BROKEN PATHS:
./assets/og-image.jpg
./assets/gallery/[multiple files]
./assets/videos/[multiple files]
./assets/story/[multiple files]
./assets/icons/[multiple files]
./assets/team/[multiple files]
```

### Impact Assessment:
- **User Experience:** Broken image icons create unprofessional appearance
- **Trust Factor:** Missing visuals reduce credibility
- **Conversion Risk:** Product galleries and demos non-functional
- **Social Sharing:** No preview images for social media
- **Mobile Experience:** Layout may break with missing images

## IMMEDIATE FIXES IMPLEMENTED
