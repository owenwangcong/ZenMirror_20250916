    });
    return htmlErrors;
  },
  
  // Responsive tests
  async testResponsiveness(page) {
    const devices = ['iPhone 12', 'iPad', 'Desktop'];
    for (const device of devices) {
      await page.setViewport(devices[device].viewport);
      await page.screenshot({
        path: `qa/screenshots/${device}.png`
      });
      // Visual regression testing
    }
  },
  
  // Performance tests
  async measurePerformance(page) {
    const metrics = await page.evaluate(() => {
      return JSON.stringify(performance.getEntriesByType('navigation'));
    });
    return metrics;
  },
  
  // Interaction tests
